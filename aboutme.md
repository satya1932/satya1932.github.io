My name is **Sajjala, Sreekar *(sree)* Reddy**. I am currently pursuing Master's degree in Computer-Aided Mechanical Engineering ([CAME](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/dfvw "RWTH Page")) at RWTH Aachen University with a specialization in Conception of Machines. I finished my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at BML Munjal University.\\
\\
Ever since I strated pursing my interest in Mechanical Engineering (ME) I was piqued by the ability to study physical phenomena using mathematical equations. Bachelor's degree in ME helped me build my foundations strong at Machine Design, Automotives, Robotics, Fluid/Thermo-dynamics and Conventional/ Additive Manufacturing. I was intrigued by Computer-Aided Design and Engineering (CAD | CAE). I have solid theoretical and practical experience at using CAD software. I am a certified [Siemens-NX](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KhHpP0kOXLC9mXPEobZGrETynG6MXUZu/view "Certification link") user and proficient in Pro-E, PTC Creo, SolidWorks, Salome and Auto CAD for CAD. Finite Element Methods (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) motivated me to learn more about the structural and fluid characteristics using numerical simulations; I try to employ simulation studies in most of my experimental projects. My courseware and research helped me augment my knowledge beyond ME and introduced me to Artificial Intelligence (AI); I worked on a couple of projects related to ML and ANNs using python, TensorFlow 2.0, Keras, and Scikit-learn. Currently, I am working on my Mini-Thesis "[Development of an intelligent simulation-based model for design evaluation of cooling channels for L-PBF](../2020-02-26-master-minithesis/)" to integrate CFD and AI to improve heat transfer in AM application.\\

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
