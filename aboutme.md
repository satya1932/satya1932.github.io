I am Sajjala, Sreekar Reddy (you can call me *sree*). I am currently pursuing Master's degree in Computer-Aided Mechanical Engineering ([CAME](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/dfvw "RWTH Page")) at RWTH Aachen University with a specialization in Conception of Machines. I finished my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at BML Munjal University.

I am passionate about Design, Simulation, Programming, and Artificial Intelligence.    

**Design** - I have solid theoretical and practical experience at using CAD (Computer-Aided Design). I am a certified [Siemens-NX](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KhHpP0kOXLC9mXPEobZGrETynG6MXUZu/view "Certification link") user and proficient in Pro-E, PTC Creo, SolidWorks, Salome and Auto CAD for CAD.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
